😲This is going to sound crazy😲, but I think kindness 😘😳🙌is actually the answer here🙋😸👦. Everyone's talking👤😫😓 about how we need to fight fire with fire now🔥💢🔥, but I think that's the trap🚰🔯🚨. I will always believe👶👆👦as we were all raised 🏃🏄🏂to believe that love conquers hate💖👊😣. The dark has no chance against the light🌚🔪🌞. In this Duginist💂👺👾onslaught spearheaded by a lie about truth👻👀👄, that it's relative, we must remember📊😭🙇; No✋✋✋. Love conquers 💟💝💞hate or monsters reign😾👿👹. That is true and will always be true🙆😙. We should be tweeting🐦🐍💀 Trump that it's ok to retire at his age💰👴🏨, that he 👏won👏 against impossible⛔❌⤵️ odds and no one 👴👵👱can ever take that away from him😠😬🙅.If the Russians 🇷🇺💯🔝can influence him via twitter🐦🐍💀, so can we👦👦👦.
